<p>Uranus is this Signs ruling planet and its expression is in the form of revolution, change, unpredictability and disruption. </p>

<p>Aquarius understands that the individual is a part of the whole and can only progress in that way. Progress has no meaning if done alone. The earth only evolves with the entire humanitys evolution. </p>

<p>This Zodiac Sign is the change initiator of society. It thinks differently, acts differently and is simply different. This Sign is non conformist in the true sense of the word and yet not a rebel. Its not biased or judgmental. An evolved Aquarius knows that all people are unique and to be respected regardless. </p>

<p>In general this Zodiac Sign is innovative, friendly, unconventional, idealistic, and good at communications. </p>

<p>In matters of the heart this Sign's temperament is caring, sensitive, loyal, and very honest. </p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of Aquarius: highly strung, dispassionate, aloof, unpredictable, eccentric, and erratic in behavior. </p>

<br>
           <h2 id="aqua_sun"><center>Sun in Aquarius</center></h2>
    <p>The Aquarius Sun Sign personality is brilliant, free-spirited and eccentric. If they don't act like any Sign you can recognize, they are probably an Aquarius Sun Sign. Intellectual, they are gifted with an analytical mind. Many geniuses are born under this Sign. 
</p><p>
They are ahead of their time, so others may think they're a bit strange. They may have a difficult time staying in the present since they would rather focus on the future.
</p><p>
They need to have freedom and have time to be an individual, even when in a relationship. The best marriage partner is a friend first, so if you fall for an Aquarius Sun Sign, give them plenty of time. They don't like to be smothered, they need their space. While they are physically in the moment, their brain may be elsewhere, maybe contemplating what everything means that is happening, rather than enjoying the emotions of the moment. Because of this, they may come across as impersonal or detached.
</p><p>
They keep to themselves and don't speak about their problems very easily. Once someone is let into the inner circle, however, they will do anything for them. They are faithful and loyal when they make a close friend or embrace a love. They may even end up being disappointed emotionally because they tend to expect more out of others than may be reasonable.
</p><p>
Aquarius Sun Sign people are social, charming and friendly. Their outgoing personality makes them popular. They want to solve the problems of the world or make life better for mankind. Their main problem is they tend to live in a world of ideas and concepts rather than reality. This detached, unemotional way of looking at life can make communication with them a bit difficult at times. They need to learn how to connect with others emotionally.
</p><p>
When stressed, they feel claustrophobic. It may be hard for them to explain to their spouse or friends why they need time alone. Spouses can become upset or confused because they will clam up, tune out and not explain what is bothering them. Sometimes, they need time away from family but will spend it with friends. This can be very difficult to explain to the family, and usually they dont even try. They need mental variety, though they will usually remain faithful on other levels.
</p><p>
Those born with an Aquarius Sun Sign are charismatic, and usually the leader of any group they are in. They are smart, independent and original. They also have a bit of a rebellious streak that makes them appealing to others. They appear to find friendship more important than love. While this isn't true, it is still hard to see the truth from the outside. This can be frustrating to potential partners. They need to be prepared to throw out the rulebook. Living with an Aquarius Sun Sign can be challenging, exasperating and exciting. There are two sides to the Aquarius Sun Sign personality: outgoing, eccentric and exuberant; and shy, patient and quiet. Their real depth of character may remain hidden.
</p><p>
Professionally, they make great inventors, innovators or designers. If artistic, their expression pushes the envelope of convention. They like technology, and may get into computer graphics, video game design or other forms of programming. They make excellent writers, broadcasters, journalists, teachers and social workers and a few excel as therapists or holistic healers.

           <h3 id="aqua_moon"><center>Moon in Aquarius</center></h3>

Aquarius Moon is very observant. They love to study human nature and analyze why everyone around them acts the way they do. They are often shy themselves, and may appear a bit detached. If you sit down and talk with an Aquarius Moon, they will probably tell you that they always felt "different" when they were growing up. While they can be sociable, at heart they would rather be on their own.
     </p><p>
They may have a strong ego, and they"ll do their level best to be unusual. It is not their lot to be mainstream or "fit in." They can be idealistic and progressive, but they pretend that jealousy, fear and possessiveness don't exist… that they are somehow above such petty emotions. This may make them appear distant and emotionally unavailable.
</p><p>
They can be very stubborn about getting their way. As they get older, they learn to handle themselves better. They feel a strong need for independence at any age. They take great pride in their family, and will often brag of their accomplishments. With their desire to shock those around them, if they grew up in a more conservative household, they will be bragging about how they changed that.
</p><p>
Moon in Aquarius may be prone to temper tantrums when young, even though as they grow they end up feeling that emotions are "messy." While they can be so good at understanding others' motivations and behaviors, they often lose touch with their own. This happens because they get too caught up in what they want to achieve rather than what is reality.
</p><p>
Aquarius Moon Sign person is kind and compassionate, though it may tend to be shown more as a broad philosophy rather than in actual actions. While they may seem aloof, in fact they enjoy the eccentricities of those around them, and they feel confident in giving their partners a lot of freedom. Their optimism and friendliness helps them attract lots of friends. When they are unhappy, they tend to focus on their activities to such an extent that those around them have difficulty figuring out that something is wrong.
</p><p>
Aquarius Moon is an intellectual that is both intense and intuitive. They love all aspects of freedom, both on a personal level as well as in the wider sense for humanity. They can work long hours to support a cause they believe in. Playful and childlike, they can have a great sense of humor, but they must be cautious they don't inadvertently hurt an other's feelings while trying to be funny. They are great dreamers, preferring to keep their head in the clouds at times.
</p><p>
Aquarius Moon can be unreliable about the little details in life, but they are seldom flaky. They are usually loyal and trustworthy and make terrific friends. Criticism can make them stop in their tracks and dig in their heels like a donkey. They expect to be accepted just as they are, even when they are wildly unpredictable. Their charm makes it difficult to remain angry with them for long.

</p><p>

They may feel a bit claustrophobic with a partner who is clingy or high maintenance. They do best when they get a little space once in awhile. They do best with someone who won't judge their outlandish ideas and who may be as unusual as they are.
</p><p>
As a friend, they may be a member of many groups or clubs.

They don't like to stagnate, and they have a unique ability to be able to step back and get a new perspective on their situation. While others see them as calming influences, they are not above stirring up a little controversy to make things interesting.
