<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Capricorn Sign</h1>


<p>Capricorn understands that dreams need to have a blue print in reality. They need to be designed, planned and built with precision. Even if that means emulating another's success, success needs to be achieved. </p>

<p>This Signs lesson is all about taking charge of your dreams and fulfilling them; however, every one knows higher the summit, more the climb. Yet, the summit of the mountain is the purpose of our lives...more so for a Capricorn. </p>

<p>This Zodiac Sign is driven by the influence of Saturn; the teacher who teaches through experience, challenges, problems and situations. Saturn provides the endurance, patience and determination to overcome all odds. </p>

<p>In general, this Sign leans toward being practical, reliable, ambitious, and goal oriented, as well as, highly structured, disciplined and very responsible </p><p>In relationships the Capricorn is strong, helpful, caring and very sympathetic. </p>

<p>Every Sign has positive and negative energies. The following words describe the darker side of this Zodiac Sign: Pessimistic, gloomy, overbearing, condescending, inhibited, grudging and fatalistic. </p>
        
<br>
<br>
           <h2 id="cap_sun"><center>Sun in Capricorn</center></h2>
    <p>Self-confident, calm and hardworking, the Capricorn Sun Sign personality is practical, responsible and persistent. If someone starts a project and drops the ball, Capricorn Sun Sign sees it through to the end. Those born under this Sign will be experts at finding the right resources that are needed and make the best out of it. They may be perceived as stuffy or rigid and so they need to learn to bend when life doesn't go the way they want. Sometimes their seriousness can make them appear unhappy and they can be difficult to approach because they look so formal and aloof. In reality, they are just cautious.
</p><p>
In love, they feel happy and high on emotion. They tend to be jealous, but they remain faithful. Capricorn Sun Signs like to be married. Once they find that special someone, they tend not to let go and so, many will only marry once. They feel that they won't get too many chances at love. They adore taking care of their partner and family, although they must feel needed and appreciated. This Sign understands the ups and downs in a relationship better than most, and they are not easily disheartened when things are not going smoothly.
</p><p>
Profound thinkers, they explore all their options before taking action. They have excellent memories and love to learn. Rational, clearheaded and logical, they can concentrate very well. Despite a natural skepticism, they are often intrigued with the occult.
</p><p>
Capricorn Sun Sign will carefully scope out the land at a social event before deciding how to interact with the group. They feel everyone is always making judgments about them (like they do about others), so they feel the need to check everything out before they relax. Making friends isn't easy for them, but those they do get their intense loyalty.
</p><p>
Capricorn Sun Signs are creative, but they prefer practical applications like architecture, decorating, commercial art and fine art. 
</p><p>
Material success is important to them. They do well in professions that work with money or mathematics. Speculators, bankers, economists, managers, contractors, real estate agents, scientists, farmers, engineers these are all professions that they excel at. They also make good teachers and administrators. This Sign enjoys working, and when stressed, they just work harder and become more focused. This kind of stress can wear them down, however, so they need to be reminded to relax and spend some time playing.
</p><p>
On the negative side, Capricorn Sun Sign may be too reserved and conservative. They may lack a sense of humor and be excessively pessimistic. If they fail, they may become unhappy or melancholy. This can lead to depression. Self-centeredness may be a problem, and they may not interact well with others, even in close relationships. They may feel left out that people don't like them, or they may feel taken advantage of. They can also make a bitter enemy. On the positive side, theyre shrewd, responsible, and put others before themselves. They can be witty and capricious at times and are tactful and very loyal.

           <h3 id="cap_moon"><center>Moon in Capricorn</center></h3>
 <p><font size="2">
Capricorn Moon needs to feel useful and productive. They are competent and collected, even when their emotions are churning beneath the surface. They want realistic goals and clear boundaries set. They are not risk takers. They much prefer security and safety and plan ahead for every eventuality.
</p><p>
Capricorn Moon does not deal well with all those messy emotions they are frightened of dealing with them. While they can have some mood swings and can dip pretty far into the darkness themselves, they don't like to delve into this side. The Capricorn Moon Sign person is their own worst critic, and they can be really hard on themselves. They often hide their own sensitivity behind a sarcastic demeanor. They are painfully aware of their faults and weaknesses, and try very diligently to compensate for them.
</p><p>
Moon in Capricorn may come across as cold and calculating, but in reality they just don't feel comfortable letting their feelings hang out in public. They prefer to be organized and efficient; practical to the bone. Those born under this Moon Sign have a strong need to feel worthwhile. They want to be respectable in the eyes of others. Patient and able to endure quite a bit, Capricorn Moon has a big sense of duty. They jump to take responsibility on the job or at home. They may feel that they give more than they get, and it takes a lot for them to learn that others are giving back to them. They need to learn to give affection they may feel it; they just tend not to show it very well to those they love.
</p><p>
In a relationship, they are often unable or unwilling to see what their partner wants or needs. They tend to worry and find it difficult to relate to those who have different values and opinions. They have a hard time discussing their own problems. It is rare that they feel relaxed and content within themselves. They fear rejection. Unless everything is outlined clearly, they feel insecure. It may take them a long time to find someone to trust and love. They mellow with age as competition isn't so important and can genuinely be a lot of fun as they get older.
</p><p>
Capricorn Moon likes to get their own way. They can be ambitious and strong of will, especially as it helps their own career. They like the spotlight, and do well in public positions. Often very intelligent, they have a great respect of knowledge, and they know how to use it to their benefit. They do have a problem with holding anger and resentment deep inside, and can actually cause illness or depression within themselves because they don't deal with their feelings.
</p><p>
Moon in Capricorn is dignified and tenacious. They are able to concentrate well, and do not like to be idle. They can motivate others. When they do lose control, you might as well be standing in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius. Luckily, this doesn't happen very often.
