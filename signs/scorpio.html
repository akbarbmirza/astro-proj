<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Scorpio Sign</h1>

<p>As the natural ruler of the House of Others Resources, Scorpio governs over sex, death, and other peoples money.</p>

<p>The energies associated with Pluto, the Signs ruling planet, are power, death, rebirth, transformation and thoughts that reside in the darkest recesses of our mind; thoughts that we may be ashamed and shocked to have. This Zodiac Sign is aware and accepts this dark side of the world. </p>

<p>All cruelty springs from weakness and this Sign possesses an almost psychic ability to understand and use this weakness; whether for positive or negative purposes. Individuals who rise above the negative can use its abilities for the benefit of mankind. </p>

<p>An enlightened Scorpio can be truly compassionate and understanding when it comes to the struggles and hardships faced by others. </p>

<p>In intimate relationships theyre passionate, seductive, sensual and very demonstrative.</p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of this Zodiac Sign: obsessive-compulsive, secretive, inflexible, perverted and even sadistic. </p>

<br>
<br>
           <h2 id="scorp_sun"><center>Sun in Scorpio</center></h2>
    <p>Scorpio Sun Sign is the sign of transformation. Intense and profound, they are intelligent, affable and courteous. They are self-reliant and in control, but underneath they are full of emotional energy. The Scorpio Sun Sign personality may be magnetic and even somewhat hypnotic. They can emulate the phoenix and seem to perish, only to be reborn and attain new heights.
</p><p>
Sun Sign Scorpio are imaginative and have strong powers of reason. They are adept at using their intuition, and have a good handle on critical and analytical skills. They can be obsessive, which can give them the potential for genius. They may give the impression of being aloof or withdrawn when in truth they don't miss a single detail of what is happening around them. Nothing is forgotten; it is merely filed away to be used when it is most advantageous.
</p><p>
This talent can be very helpful in business. Being able to keep their assets hidden until they are needed is a Scorpio trait. They do well in jobs that require analyzing, such as investigation, research, espionage, the military, science, mysteries, medicine, law or psychology, and if a job offers prestige and money, so much the better. They can also be cold and calculating, and may be ruthless in the pursuit of power. They may be overly demanding, unforgiving and unreasonable. As employees they tend to keep to themselves and do their work. They are low-maintenance and industrious. If they do something kind for a co-worker or someone in need, chances are they will do so anonymously.
</p><p>
The negative side of their personality can be intimidating, revengeful and manipulative. They model the extremes of behavior, and can be very jealous. They can be rebellious, and those who get into political extremism can make the most ruthless terrorists. They can be brooding, aggressive and arrogant, and some indulge in sadistic brutality. On the other hand, those born under this Sign may be a fan of procrastination and be a bit self-indulgent. This can happen in part because they can get so overwhelmed that they just shut down. Their directness can be overly critical or hurtful. They can be loners they don't need a lot of social interaction to make them happy. On the positive side they are disciplined, have great willpower, and are very sensitive. They have a depth of character that can be inspiring. When they give you a compliment, it is an honest assessment. They make a loyal friend, but don't ever betray them, for they find it difficult to forgive.
</p><p>
Scorpio Sun Signs are loving and loyal to their partners. They're passionate and revel in a relationship that returns that passion. They can also lose themselves to pleasure and forget about the rest. If they get too deeply hurt, they may just turn themselves off emotionally and become celibate. Many Scorpio Sun Sign relationships are stormy, but extremely exciting. Interestingly, numerous "star-crossed" lovers have a Scorpio component, especially if there is a tragic aspect.
</p><p>
Moderation is also difficult for the Scorpio Sun Sign but very necessary. They need to maintain a healthy diet with a little exercise; if they overdo their exercise or sports, they may end up hurting themselves.

           <h3 id="scorp_moon"><center>Moon in Scorpio</center></h3>
           <p><font size="2">

They have a need for change and rebirth. Their life may be full of drama and upheaval which they feel is out of their control. But if their life begins to feel "normal" they are the first one to create some test for someone in their life just to create excitement. Emotional drama fulfills them.
</p><p>
Scorpio Moon wants it all they don't do anything halfway or waste their time with meaningless relationships. They want commitment. They may also expect their partner to give up something for them, although they have a deep fear of betrayal. They may test their partners, even if they don't mean to. They come off as being suspicious, although once they have committed themselves to a partner; they are extremely loyal and protective.
</p><p>

Moon Sign Scorpio can be intimidating and are difficult to scare or shock. They have the ability to size up a person or a situation in a matter of seconds. Their powers can be used for good or evil, as the saying goes and many times it depends on how they were raised as children. Those who were manipulated or deprived will not open up to others, while those raised in a nurturing environment will most likely be mild-tempered and easy to get along with. They can be jealous, possessive and self-indulgent. They can also be rather destructive, both to themselves and others. On the good side, they can be vulnerable, intelligent and ambitious.
</p><p>
Scorpio Moon is tenacious, and once they want something, they are like the dog that won't let go. Their stubbornness can stand in their own way at times, or it can help them overcome bad habits. They tend to be emotional, materialistic, sensual and secretive. They are also very creative. Their fighting spirit is strong and it is difficult for them to admit defeat. They can be fiercely competitive, especially with those of their own sex. With the opposite sex, they can often be wrapped around the other person's little finger, wanting to indulge that person's every whim. They could use a little balance in their life in this area.
</p><p>
Charismatic, Scorpio Moon attracts many, and must exercise caution so they are not tempted into multiple relationships. They don't like to be criticized. They are seldom mainstream in their ideals and don't always conform to all of society's rules.
