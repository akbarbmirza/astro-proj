<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Leo Sign</h1>

<p>This Sign is driven by the influence of the Sun, which encourages developing and expressing creativity, personal power and leadership abilities. </p>

<p>As the Sun is the center of our universe it is therefore understandable why this Zodiac Sign predictably enjoys being the center of attention. </p>

<p>This Signs expression is always striking and magnanimous. Dramatic, romantic and faithful are just a few of the characteristics that comprise a positive Leo.</p>

<p>As the natural ruler of the House of Pleasure, it is associated with fun, love, creativity, children and games of chance.</p>

<p>In their relations with others, this Zodiac Sign is open, earnest and heartfelt.</p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of Leo: pompous, dogmatic, patronizing, bossy, interfering, and intolerant. 
        </p>
        
<br>
<br>
           <h2 id="leo_sun"><center>Sun in Leo</center></h2>
    <p>
The charismatic center of attention, the Leo Sun Sign personality is ambitious, dominant and full of confidence. A born leader, they are most comfortable when they are in charge, and they bring out a strong sense of loyalty in their followers. Strong-willed and independent, they often place themselves in the center ring. They may be philosophical and spiritual, even if they aren't necessarily religious. They dream big, but have a practical follow-through that inspires confidence in others. They thrive on adversity, and are idealistic. They like to make an indelible first impression. Whether that is with fashion or by choosing a gaudy appearance one won't soon forget, depends on the individual. When they get what they want, they return friendship, warmth and loyalty to those around them.
</p><p>
Without direction, Leo Sun Sign can be arrogant or overly controlling. Their challenge, therefore, is to conquer their own powerful nature. They can be stubborn and temperamental. Change is difficult to adjust to for them, at least at first. If jealous, they do not hesitate to use trickery or cunning to defeat their rivals. Possible negative traits include being self-centered, boastful, snobbish and disdainful. Luckily, they are usually quick to notice how others see them, and they may be able to adapt to a more likable persona. They can be their own worst enemy when they go too far trying to get attention. It may actually turn away those they hope to attract.
</p><p>
They are also loyal and devoted, especially in romantic relationships. At the same time, they may have numerous love affairs just because of the sensual pleasure involved. They like lots of affection and can be intensely enthusiastic. If rejected in love, they can be as ice. Once they give up on a relationship, there is no going back. They have a gregarious personality and hold marriage, family and children close to heart. They want to be the king or queen of the house and they will strive to be the best they can be. Their home will be a showplace as they use it as a backdrop for their perfect family. If you put your Leo on a pedestal, they will do all they can to keep you happy. If you try to take control, you may cause a power struggle that may end the entire relationship.
</p><p>
Professionally, the Leo Sun Sign does well at any occupation where they have room to advance. Politicians, managers, organizers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and project leaders are frequent career choices. Any job with a prestigious title may be attractive to them. Performing and painting may appeal to artistic Leos. They are good motivators for their team or subordinates. This Sun Sign usually does well with finances, if they manage to control their spending. They believe that looking successful will attract success. This can cause them to overspend at the wrong time or to be extravagant to stroke their ego.
</p><p>
The Leo Sun Sign personality responds well to compliments. If a loved one disappoints them, they are quickly disillusioned. They are extremely sensitive to criticism, and are slow to forgive. Intelligent and motivated, they work hard to make those around them comfortable as long as they feel appreciated.

           <h3 id="leo_moon"><center>Moon in Leo</center></h3>
           <p><font size="2">
Leo Moon likes to be the center of attention when they are comfortable in the situation. They may do a lot of entertaining at home and they have a great sense of comic timing. Those born with the Moon in Leo are talented organizers, and may bring that out to the point of trying to organize and control their friends and family. They want to create and entertain although they may end up being too lazy to actually put things together as often as they would like. Their natural bossiness helps them be good at delegating chores to others, although deep down they really want to treat others fairly.
</p><p>
Leo Moon needs a lot of love to do well in the world. They can be overly dramatic if they feel slighted, and they are prone to sulking. Luckily, they prefer to perform their scenes in the privacy of their home. Public displays may hurt their image. They would rather appear dignified in public, since social status is everything. They may be a bit vain or snobbish, but they are very loyal.
</p><p>
They are usually popular and sociable, and they have a lot of integrity. Their sense of justice is strong, and they are usually easy to reason with. They are passionate, but may tend towards exaggeration. They can get so caught up in a moment that they may do or say things that later won't be remembered. They can be generous to a fault; in fact, it can become overwhelming to the recipient at times. They can't stand ingratitude, so if you are the one being showered with generosity, express your thanks.
</p><p>
Pride is Leo Moon's downfall. Their ego pushes them to take charge of everything, which may make them appear domineering. They are attracted to power and status. Stubbornness is a trait that helps them get what they want. At the same time, they can be very idealistic and make great personal sacrifices if they believe in a cause.
</p><p>
They are protective of their own and others' freedoms. In a relationship, they may be on the jealous side, even if they are not really possessive. When they go through a break-up, they may feel more pain to their ego rather than their heart.
</p><p>
The Leo Moon Sign may be graced with artistic ability, or they may just be interested in the arts in some fashion. They have a natural air of authority coupled with dignity. Leo Moon is not a big risk taker unless they know they'll come out on top. They don't like to fail in front of others.
</p><p>
Those born under the Moon Sign Leo do not take advice well, though they are happy to give it. They have a lot in common with the cat they feel they are always right and no one should tell them what to do. They may be materialistic, but they accept responsibility with grace and honor. They can face adversity without falling apart, and when fortune smiles upon them, they are always willing to share.

They may take disagreements personally since everything they do is attached to their ego. They seek recognition for their ideas, so it is difficult for them to participate in brainstorming or other group activities.

They may exaggerate at times, but they are very convincing and entertaining. They make excellent teachers, enthralling their students no matter what their age.
