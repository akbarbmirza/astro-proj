<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Libra Sign</h1>


<p>This Zodiac Sign represents objective balance through rationalization; always seeking equality, harmony and balance. This accurately reflects Librans drive to compare and justify as it naturally commands a good critical faculty, making them able to stand back and be impartial in judgment.</p>

<p>This Sign is driven by the energy of Venus which shows us, through our freedom of choice and responsibility, how to interact intimately with others, as well as, our ability to love and commit.</p>

<p>As the natural ruler of the House of Partnerships, it governs marriage, business partners, contracts, known adversaries and law courts.</p>

<p>In relationships Librans are romantic, charming, easygoing and sociable. They typically exhibit a high level of sensitivity; having an innate understanding of the needs and feelings of others.</p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of this Zodiac Sign: lazy, resentful, indecisive, self indulgent, flirtatious and easily influenced.</p>

           <h2 id="libra_sun"><center>Sun in Libra</center></h2>
    <p>
The Libra Sun Sign personality is always performing a balancing act. They want to keep all aspects of their life in harmony. This can be a very difficult thing to accomplish. They can actually compromise their personality by striving too hard to keep the peace.
    </p><p>
The Libra Sun Sign is sensitive to others' needs, especially with their partners, with whom they may share an almost psychic bond. They are happiest as part of a couple. They abhor violence, cruelty and crudeness. Conflict drives them crazy. They will bend over backwards to make peace until they can't handle it any longer and blow their top. One of their problems is they may get that lid put back on before they've released all their anger and tension, so they are destined to explode again at a later date. They may swing back and forth between rudeness and gentleness because of this aspect.
</p><p>
Libra Sun Sign tries to understand the other person's point of view, often compromising, at their cost, to keep a relationship happy. This happens in love, friendships and work relationships. They really like the opposite sex and are so romantic they often come off as sentimental. They make great marriage partners because they really bond with their spouse and try their best to be empathic to their needs. They are also tolerant of their partner's failings or weaknesses. They want reality to match their fantasy of what love should be. Some Libras have the perfect partner built up so much in their head that they find it next to impossible to find someone that fits.
</p><p>
They are usually well-liked by their friends, and they love to socialize. They do well in situations where they are surrounded by admirers. They love beauty, luxury and good taste. In turn, Libra Sun Signs are loyal and truly interested in your life. They may sugar coat things sometimes to make them more palatable.
</p><p>
On the negative side, they can be flighty, shallow and flirtatious. They can be indecisive and change their opinions every other day. Some are timid or too easygoing to stand up for themselves. It can be frustrating when they don't show any anger or annoyance in circumstances that warrant it, yet in others they fly into a huge storm of rage. They may need to work on self-worth, as they often have low self-esteem because they put so much focus on others. On the positive side, their indecision isn't because they are wishy-washy it is because they spend too much time weighing their options. Once their mind is made up, they can be very single-minded. Libra Sun Signs can be some of the most civilized people you will meet. They exude charm and elegance.
</p><p>
Libra Sun Signs make excellent diplomats, judges, counsellors and advisors. They may excel in the arts more so than in intellectual pursuits, but even in the arts they are not the type to be avant-garde. They make good critics because they are good at observation and perception. They are good designers, sculptors, artists and actors. Owning an art gallery or antique shop would also fall into their talents. They are good net-workers and are talented at bringing people together. They work hard, but dislike dirty work.

           <h3 id="libra_moon"><center>Moon in Libra</center></h3>
           <p><font size="2">
Libra Moon does not like to be alone they thrive in a partnership. Many will get married young or choose to move in with someone. In order to facilitate this, they may make a lot of concessions to their partner in order to keep the peace. They are social, sympathetic and they love a rousing debate.

</p><p>
Even if they don't want to, The Libra Moon Sign person will see flaws in their relationships and everything around them. Even worse, until it is fixed, it will continue to gnaw at them. Although a natural diplomat with acquaintances, they will argue with their partners until they win even if it takes a long time. Having the last word is important to them. You may feel like they've got you on trial all the time and you're getting grilled, though they're great to have on your side when they're supporting you.
</p><p>
Moon in Libra likes to have their way and will accomplish their goals with the support of others. They make excellent planners, but they would rather delegate to others the actual hands on work.

</p><p>
They are often uncertain. Their moods change from moment to moment, not only from up to down and back again, but waffling back and forth as well. They are even-tempered throughout all the changes and usually cheerful. They are transparent it is hard for them to hide their feelings. At the same time, they can change their personality to fit who they are spending time with. This is skill, not a trick. This allows other to feel comfortable around them, though it may be confusing at times. Intellectual stimulation is a must.
</p><p>
Indecisive, Libra Moon must weigh each side of a decision over and over to make sure they are choosing correctly even on what to have for lunch. At the same time, they are concerned with balance in life. If they sense things are out of balance, they will do what they must to redress this fact, even if someone has to lose out once in awhile.

Neptune in Libra may bring lessons regarding partnerships. While they crave relationships, they may need to learn to sacrifice or compromise in order to make them work.
