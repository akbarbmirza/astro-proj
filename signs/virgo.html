<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Virgo Sign</h1>

<p>This Mutable Sign  depicts fluidity and changeability as well as adaptability to environment </p>

<p>It's also ruled by Mercury, the messenger of the gods, and so governs human intellect and communicative faculties, practicing both analytical and critical approaches to life.</p>

<p>As the natural ruler of the House of Health and Service, there is an urge to improve everything and everyone.</p>

<p>The idealistic nature of this Zodiac Sign commands a critical eye. This is characterized by a ceaseless pursuit to perfect. This may be both a curse and a gift depending on the purpose of action. </p>

<p>In love and relationships Virgo is devoted, charming, sensuous and caring. </p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of  this Zodiac Sign: hyper-critical, pessimistic, destructive, moody and cynical. </p>
     
<br>
<br>
           <h2 id="virgo_sun"><center>Sun in Virgo</center></h2>
    <p>
The Virgo Sun Sign personality seeks perfection in themselves and everything around them. They can be a bit demanding, but this is because they see all the details like they were looking through a microscope. This gives them an excellent eye for detail, but they may miss the forest for the trees. They are practical, down to earth and good with their hands. They are fastidious and love cleanliness. They tend to be conservative in all areas of their life. On the surface they may appear cold emotionally, but this is usually from their habit of suppressing their natural feelings in the name of control. They are charming and dignified. Intellectually they are inquisitive, logical and methodical. They are excellent at analyzing a problem, no matter how complicated it may be. They are usually modest and self-restrained and more than willing to serve. They have a gift for creating order out of chaos and give of themselves selflessly when others are in need.
</p><p>
Virgo Sun Signs are selective when choosing friends and partners. Because of this, they may be perceived as distant or aloof. An intellectual at heart, it may seem that they arent connecting with their feelings; however, they do figure out their feelings by using their heads. People born under this Sign tend to put their relationships in concentric circles, with their intimate and family relationships on the innermost circle, and then close friends, then acquaintances. Those in the outer circles are not subjected to the criticisms that the inner circle are. If you are involved with a Virgo, be prepared for your faults to be brought up eventually. While they may be critical of you, they are even more critical of themselves. They may have difficulty trusting others and may lack confidence in themselves.
</p><p>
Virgo Sun Signs creativity tends toward the intellectual or finely detailed. They make excellent architects, engineers, writers, designers or other craftsmen. As artists, they seem to enjoy working in miniature. They are good at math, editing, and they also make great secretaries. They are generally good with money. They watch their pennies carefully and seldom spend without reason.
</p><p>
It can be difficult for a Virgo Sun Sign to delegate, though they are excellent in business in other respects. In fact, they can tackle jobs that overwhelm others and be successful. 
</p><p>
They are productive and prefer to stay busy. Their problem solving abilities are amazing, and indeed, this stimulates their intellectual needs.
</p><p>
Virgo Sun Sign can be overly health conscious. Many will choose a career in medicine or health fields to stay abreast of the latest information. They like to compartmentalize everything in their life, so balancing the mind and body is an important part of their life's journey. As students, for example, they will often concentrate so much on their studies that they neglect to eat. They can also be a bit of a hypochondriac if they focus too much on themselves. They tend to be nervous and worry a lot and may be seen as compulsive. They need to take time to relax and let go.

           <h3 id="virgo_moon"><center>Moon in Virgo</center></h3>
           <p><font size="2">
Virgo Moon looks to the little things in life for their happiness and security. They may deny it, but they actually enjoy activities like running errands, taking care of details, and so on. They may complain about it, but as long as they feel appreciated they will do their best to not only take care of themselves, they'll take care of you, too. They will usually be the first to volunteer to help someone else.
</p><p>
They may be a bit low in self-esteem, but many are very happy to have a normal, pedestrian life. Simplicity is their mantra and they feel most at home when they can go through life without a lot of public attention. Because of this, they may be accused of being an underachiever or not setting their sights high enough. In reality, they are easily stressed, and they are much happier when they stay within their comfort level.
</p><p>
Virgo Moon Sign loves routine. They are very unhappy without one, or at least feeling they have a job that is necessary. They may appear fussy or be labeled as a complainer, but they really can't function well without their routine. They do best at jobs that require a lot of detail or micromanaging.
</p><p>
They will show how much they care in small, practical ways like putting away your laundry. Open affection may cause them to pull back a bit, and they are often shy when meeting new people. Once they are comfortable, however they are happy to be themselves. They are trustworthy and reliable and are good sources of advice or help in just about any situation. Their practicality makes them very useful to keep around. They make excellent counselors, as they are very talented at comforting others and making them feel better.
</p><p>
In a relationship, Moon in Virgo can be shy and possibly intimidated. They are very aware of themselves, and when combined with low self-esteem, it can really interfere with forming a normal, healthy relationship. They can end up being too critical of themselves. Once they gain self-confidence, they can be a wonderful partner with a lot to contribute. They tend to keep their own feelings bottled up, which can cause health issues in the long run. Others may see Virgo Moon as cold or unaffectionate, which in most cases is not true. Moon in Virgo is a born skeptic. When faced with blind faith, they can't help but pick at it. They can be frustrating because they insist on finding the practical application to everything. Virgo Moon is full of curiosity, yet seems apathetic at the same time. This can confuse some people. While they can dish out the criticism, they are extremely sensitive to receiving it themselves.
</p><p>
Virgo Moon likes to stay busy, and they are happy as long as their life feels under their control. They may put up invisible barriers to others, whether they realize it or not. They hope that others will put forth the extra effort to get to know them anyway.

They don't like people who have habits they dislike, and they appreciate someone who is punctual.
</p><p>
Since Virgo Venus attends to all the practical details of a relationship, you may not know what to do for them. They may have a simple answer for you, but you may still not be clear. Most of these day to day details are not exciting or dramatic. They don't attract a lot of attention, so you may not even notice some of them. Virgo Venus isn't very romantic, and it doesn't take a lot to please them.
