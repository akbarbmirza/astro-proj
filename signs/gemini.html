<h3 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Gemini Sign</h3>

<p>The Gemini Zodiac Sign signifies self-awareness and the dual sides of our nature. It then brings this awareness into focus by gathering and sharing knowledge. </p>

<p>Its ruling planet is Mercury and its flow of energy influences communication. This is why Gemini governs the skill of manipulation and excels in the persuasive use of language, speech and writing. </p>

<p>This Sign also has an adaptable and inquisitive nature and is known to find success in many ways. Charming, intellectual, upbeat and creative are just a few of its characteristics. </p>

<p>Although very capable of deep love, this Zodiac Signs temperament can be emotionally inconsistent. </p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of Gemini: superficial, careless, nervous tension, a tendency to gossip, changeable and cunning.</p> 
           <br>
            <br>
       
       
           <h2 id="gemini_sun"><center>Sun in Gemini</center></h2>
    <p>
Gemini is the Sign of the Twins, and thus, they may always be of two minds. This dual nature creates a Gemini Sun Sign personality that is complex, contradictory and restless. They like to take up new activities, and then drop them just as quickly to pursue something new. The fun is in the novelty and the excitement of beginning something new. Finishing a project is not a high priority for Gemini Sun Sign. Those born under this Sign are the epitome of yin and yang, day and night, black and white.
</p><p>
Affectionate, kind and generous, the Gemini Sun Sign personality can be very thoughtful about others… as long as it doesn't interfere too much with what they want to do. They quickly learn to use their assets to their benefit, and may become unscrupulous and cunning in extreme situations. It is difficult for them to put others before themselves. They can act very childish at times, even throwing temper tantrums to get their way. Life struggles may prove too much for them, and they may become withdrawn, excessively worried or hardened. On the other hand, their versatility may help them to adapt so they ultimately gain control of the situation and are able to turn it around to suit themselves.
</p><p>
Many born with a Gemini Sun Sign are considered intuitive and may be downright brilliant. They love mental challenges, even though their concentration is short-lived. They love to soak up knowledge, but don't like the task of learning. They often fit the description of "jack of all trades, master of none." They like to analyze, but since they can see both sides of an issue, they have great difficulty making decisions. Some Gemini can use their natural intelligence to control this dual nature so it becomes very efficient and useful.
</p><p>
They may prove fickle in relationships, but it isn't intentional. Their natural inconsistency can sometimes drive them to make unwise choices. They like the excitement and intensity of the chase, and once the catch has been accomplished, they may cool off and look at the relationship more superficially. Gemini is witty and fun to be around. They make great conversation, but can also instigate quarrels and cause dissent. Their mood may change suddenly. They may do this in an effort to entertain themselves or create some excitement.
</p><p>
Those born with a Gemini Sun Sign can be very successful in life, though they may be unreliable in some circumstances. They have a gift with language, and can do well in writing, debating, or speaking. They make good diplomats, teachers, authors, journalists and lawyers. If they can get a job that requires travel, they can excel with the constant change of scenery. They make good scientists due to their natural skepticism, and may have an affinity for astronomy or medicine. They are also quick to pick the brains of others and stay on top of things on the job. They like to stay in communication with others, and are constantly networking. They do well in the military, since they don't take danger any more seriously than other areas of their life. They are artistic, and may do well as psychic researchers due to their skeptical nature.
</p><p>
Gemini is definitely fun to be around. Their charm is endearing and engaging. Just don't forget that they have two faces. Being prepared will help understand this complex person and make a long term relationship work.

           <h3 id="gemini_moon"><center>Moon in Gemini</center></h3>
           <p><font size="2">
Witty and charming, Gemini Moon is fun and pleasant to hang out with. Their twin aspect also makes them moody and irritable, though. If you can put up with the constant switch from one to the other, you will find that they are very interesting people to be around. They like to have a hand in everything, are usually well-informed and are the basis for the saying "curiosity killed the cat." Their inquisitiveness is all-encompassing. Like other air signs, the Moon Sign Gemini is adept at saying what they think is expected before they have a chance to think about it. They may also imitate others' behavior if they think it is more acceptable than just being themselves.
</p><p>
Gemini Moon needs a lot of stimulation to keep their interest. They are either, talking, reading or thinking they never stop. They bore easily. You may notice they are somewhat restless, and may worry incessantly or appear to be perpetually nervous. Since they are more likely to reason things than feel them, they are capable of handling anxiety, worry and sorry better than others.
</p><p>
Sociable and friendly, Gemini Moon has a talent with words. They have a great imagination and always have way too many irons in the fire. Some may tend to pay too much attention to what everyone else is doing and forget what they needed to take care of. They often have artistic talents if they can be persuaded to stick with it and develop them. They may pick up one interest, only to drop it a week later for another. No matter what they end up doing, they need an outlet for creativity. They also need contact with others. Social interaction is needed like they need air they can't survive without it.
</p><p>
Gemini Moon is a great organizer, even though inside they may be unsettled. While they are very open-minded, their ability to make a decision suffers for it. Even so, the versatility and adaptability that they have is an exceptional trait. Monotony is their worst fear. They prefer change and adventure. If they have a problem, they want to talk it out. They like to analyze their problems, which can make them look detached. In fact, they may feel more comfortable talking about their feelings than experiencing them. Because of this, it is common for this Sign to often feel misunderstood. If you have a friend with a Moon Sign Gemini, they will want to help you solve your problems in the fastest, most clever way they can manage. Be prepared to be peppered with questions so they can get all the facts.
</p><p>
When in a relationship, they are loyal and loving. Their problem is that those they may be attracted to physically may not stimulate them intellectually, and vice versa. While they don't like being tied down and demand a certain amount of freedom, once they have made up their mind to commit, they're in it for the long haul. Unfortunately, even to those who know them well, the Moon in Gemini person comes off as fickle.
