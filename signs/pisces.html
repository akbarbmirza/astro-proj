<h3 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Pisces Sign</h3>

<p>Neptune, Pisces ruler, expresses itself through mystical, spiritual and psychic forces. It also rules over drugs, alcohol, medication, the sea, photography, dreams and the subconscious.</p>

<p>Pisces recognizes that peace simply is within. There is an understanding that the greatest love is divine love and the greatest force is the divine force. The purpose of human life is service to humanity. This can be done by easing the pain and suffering of the needy, down trodden and the less fortunate; however, this needs to be done with detachment to avoid being sucked into the chasm of self pity and sadness.</p>

<p>Pisces energy is all about forgiving and letting go. Its karmic lesson is about detaching one self from the karmic burdens of the past. </p>

<p>Overall, this Zodiac Sign is considered to be exceptionally imaginative, sensitive, sympathetic, compassionate and extraordinarily intuitive. </p>

<p>In the area of friendship and relationship this Sign is thought to be romantic, affectionate, committed and very loyal. </p>

<p>Every Sign has positive and negative energies. The following words describe the darker side of this Zodiac Sign: secretive, gullible, fearful, impractical, weak willed, potential for addiction, easily led astray, and open to hurt. </p>

<p>Pisces represents the last phase of the Zodiac passage. The journey has come full circle. </p>

           <h2 id="pisces_sun"><center>Sun in Pisces</center></h2>
    <p>The Pisces Sun Sign personality is spiritual, compassionate and full of unconditional love. They believe that everyone is connected, no matter their differences. They may be psychic, or at least feel a part of the universal consciousness. They are emotional and instinctual. Easily discouraged, they may find themselves feeling unappreciated, so they just pack up and move on to something else.
</p><p>
There are two sides to the Pisces Sun Sign personality lost, isolated and depressed or visionaries who may be involved with healing, art, psychic arts or other spiritual practices. One feels they must choose between feeling human or divine, while the other knows how to incorporate both aspects for the greater good.
</p><p>
Those born with a Pisces Sun Sign are flexible, but it is this very flexibility that makes decision making difficult. They think in the abstract, which can make reality hard to deal with at times. It is easy for them to get stuck in limbo. They are tactful, charming, regal and reliable. Theyre good listeners and can be very observant.
</p><p>
Pisces Sun Signs are generous with friends, and they always check their ego at the door when it comes to relationships. It is easy for them to get caught up in the fantasy of romance and then come crashing down when reality hits. They are loyal to a fault and prefer to be homebodies than to remain uprooted. They are faithful to their partners. They are usually popular with others because they are so easy going and affectionate. They find it easy to accept people for what they are, and they concern themselves with the problems of others before they deal with their own. All of this self-denial may prove wearing on them eventually. They need to take time to indulge themselves and replenish themselves once in awhile.
</p><p>
Pisces Sun Signs are incurable romantics. With the right partner, they can have a fairytale marriage, but with the wrong one, it will be a nightmare because they won't be willing to let go. They are often taken advantage of because they are so forgiving and believe that everyone truly is good. As a rule they usually make excellent parents.
</p><p>
Pisces Sun Signs are creative, and can do well in music, art or literature. They may feel their best work comes from outside of themselves. Even if they are not gifted artistically themselves, they have a good artistic sensibility. They make good photographers, dancers and film-makers. Because of their compassion, they also excel in nursing or as veterinarians. Design, law, library sciences, astronomy and architecture are frequent callings; as are religious posts or jobs that require psychic abilities. They can also use their creativity in the sciences to explore new theories. Their ability to focus pays off for them. They may appear to be workaholics, but they see material wealth as a means to an end.
</p><p>
The Pisces Sun Sign personality doesnt react well to stress. They don't react well to being confined, particularly when they feel vulnerable. Time alone is the best medicine. Methods of creative visualization or being able to get lost in a book or a movie can be therapeutic as well.

           <h3 id="pisces_moon"><center>Moon in Pisces</center></h3>
 <p><font size="2">
Those born with a Pisces Moon will often have strong psychic abilities. They find it easy to walk a mile in someone else's shoes and are amazingly compassionate and full of love. Unfortunately, this capacity also makes it easy for them to lose themselves in others' problems. They are natural romantics, and never forget a gift on Valentine's Day or someone's birthday.
     </p><p>
They have a wonderfully silly sense of humor that some may find a bit off-base. Pisces Moon appears to know all the nuances of human behavior. They are easily amused. They may be labelled as "spaced out," but they are deeper than most people think. They are easily misunderstood since they often get lost in their dreams. Without the time to drift, Pisces Moon can become overwhelmed with reality. They can easily become despondent by those around them if they are not careful.
</p><p>
Moon in Pisces is sweet and soft-hearted. They genuinely care about others and are an easy touch for a hard luck story. This Moon Sign sees themselves in everyone, so they empathize with almost everyone in one way or another. They need to learn not to absorb what others are feeling, as they can be overwhelmed with the emotions they sense around them. They have an uncanny ability to understand things they have not actually experienced, which makes them very talented performers if they choose that line of work. For those who are too shy to climb up on stage, Moon in Pisces can be a talented writer, musician or artist.
</p><p>
If they don't take care of themselves, Pisces Moon can get walked on. To prevent that, they need to recognize when they need a break to recharge themselves. While they need companionship, solitude is equally as important. They are very sensitive, and can easily be hurt by insults, rejection and criticism. These soft-hearted people can get a bit of help from a religion or philosophy that will give them more strength than they have themselves. This Moon can find a lot of fulfillment by being involved with charities or spiritual causes. They are romantic and creative. Being very imaginative, they can be farsighted or impractical, depending on the situation. They may develop anxieties during their lifetimes. They make loyal friends who appreciate beauty in all its forms.
</p><p>
Pisces Moon Sign tries to avoid the mundane details of life. They are curious, almost to the point of recklessness. As a child, they can easily be bullied into going along with the crowd. This sensitivity needs to be nurtured rather than stomped on. When they feel unappreciated, they can retreat into a fantasy world that is may be hard to let go. They are easily discouraged and may fall into self-pity or a preoccupation with what can go wrong. It is important for them to have a meaning to their life. They are not attracted to material possessions, but they do like to show their emotions.
