<h1 style="text-align:center;">Interpreting the Taurus Sign</h1>

<p>Taurus is a passive Sign and turns inward for resources. As the natural ruler of the "House of Material Possessions", it gives particular attention to wealth, money, possessions, and lifes pleasures and luxuries.</p>

<p>This Zodiac Sign is driven by the energy of Venus which shows us, through our freedom of choice and responsibility, the true worth of what we attract and possess. This Sign is always sensible and practical in decisions; dedicated and willing to work hard for the things that give pleasure. Luxury and good tasting food are considered a matter of necessity. </p>

<p>Taurus is also affectionate, trustworthy, and loving when it comes to the issue of relationship and friendship. Their passive side makes them slow to anger, romantic, tender, conservative, traditional, and sensual. </p>

<p>The following words describe the darker side of Taurus: Stubborn, jealous, argumentative, loss of control, sudden angry outbursts and anger turning to violence.</p> 
           <br><br>
           <h2 id="taurus_sun"><center>Sun in Taurus</center></h2>

           </p><p>
The Taurus Sun Sign personality is practical and smart rather than intellectual. They may have a tendency to get stuck on their own opinions or get stuck in a rut, and it can be very difficult to get them to see a new point of view. Did we mention they are stubborn?

</p><p>

They are a good choice if you are looking for a friend to enjoy a night on the town with, as they appreciate the finer things in life.

</p><p>

They can span a wide variety of talents. They are usually careful with money and will gradually accumulate that which they need to maintain a good life. Security is important to them, and "comfortable" doesn't always mean the same to them as it does to someone else.

</p><p>
Taurus Sun Sign hates to feel that they are being used or manipulated. They need to know that they are safe and appreciated or they may develop resentment in some areas of their lives. They may also have a fear of loss or experience varying degrees of paranoia.
