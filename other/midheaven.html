<p>Just when you thought you had most of the important Astrology Signs in your birth chart figured out, here's another one: your Midheaven Sign.
</p><p>
Your Midheaven Sign is the Zodiac Sign that was at the southern highest point above the horizon at the moment you were born. This southern highest point is also known as the Medium Coeli, or MC for short.
</p><p>
The Midheaven is the entrance to the tenth house and relates to your career, reputation and social standing. These are your most visible achievements in the eyes of the world. This will guide you to your professional achievements and responsibilities. Your life's purpose, if you will. Your highest aspirations in life.
</p>
<center><h1>Midheaven Signs/Medium Coeli</h1></center>
      <p>
Your Midheaven Sign should give you some insight into what you need to realize your full place in life. You also must consider any planets that may be found in your ninth and tenth houses; they will modify the end results and make a difference in what career you ultimately choose and how successful you will be.
</p><p>
Of course, sometimes one must work at a job that isn't right, and it can wreak havoc upon you, spiritually, mentally and emotionally. By focusing on your MC, you can refocus on your ideal. Coupled with your natural talents and inclinations, you should eventually find your place in the world and become re-energized.
</p><p>
You can also use your Midheaven Sign to understand your personal and spiritual goals. You can gain insight into why you react the way you do to stressful situations. Being social is different for everyone. The MC can help you learn to trust your best social qualities to cultivate. It will show you how others perceive you. This can help you ascertain if your public "face" is helpful to you or not.</p>
