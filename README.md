# Teach The Class Something

For my "Teach the Class Something," I decided to show the class an old project
that I worked on. I made a website for a project that my friend was doing. It
was really interesting to work on and I got to play around with the visual
design and I was really proud of it by the end.

I wanted to show the class this project because I wanted to give them an idea of
just how powerful the tools that they were learning were. The project I made was
done using only HTML & CSS and I especially liked it's visual design (of course,
I'm a little biased in the matter).

It allowed me to demonstrate the idea of separation of concerns, and keeping the
content and the styling/layout of the page separate. I also used it to kind of
demonstrate that with not a lot of work, you can create something beautiful and
informative using just HTML and CSS, and the amount of flexibility that is given
with that.
